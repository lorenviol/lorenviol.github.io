It shoved the path of our modern smartphones, creating a closed and safe environment for all of its users with what we always knew as iOS. It was and it still is a little bit too guarded, a little bit too sealed for signor computer scientists used to a machine like Windows, Mac or Linux, where they have full freedom to control over the operating system with countless possibilities for customization and script/app developments.\nIt was inevitable.\nIf you create an enclosed and safe environment some people are always going to find ways to break in-n-out of it, for no particular reason but to gain the reassurance of being the one who is still being in control having a sort of independence. I get it, we all want to customize our devices as we please but Apple made that hard to their customers for mixed reasons, and no wonder why is still one of the tech companies with the best customer satisfaction. Look at Android for instance, you can install it literally everywhere, but at the finale developers struggle to keep up with all of its devices that often ends in either have to test their apps on every possible gadget, leading to consume lots of team resources, or that their app that might not be fully compatible for all of its users, leaving many unexpected bugs and crashes behind.\nSo, Revolution it is. Fortnite didn’t started it, it was just a sparkle that made the fire stronger. Cydia and Jailbreaks were the pioneers of it, then there was that amazing app called Delta that never made it to the App Store because of its strict guidelines, so people found ways to install it anyways, App Store or not.\nDespite the fact that iOS is still not as customizable as a Mac, and no intention from Apple to merge the two, we have many different options to: buy, install or create our own cool apps that Apple won’t allow releasing on its own store. We have Shortcuts, you can play around for pretty much everything with them, then TestFlight Apple’s own app that makes possible for developers to distribute their apps prior the debut to the App Store for the sole scope to let users beta test their algorithms. And with TestFlight another indie App Store was born, a place where every app is free and not fully overseen by the App Store big eyes (aka strict guidelines), so now developers have even more control on their creations with Airport.\nAs a user you have to submit a request to join their TestFlight beta (that is beta just for incognito reasons at Apple) and you’re all in. I’ve been personally addicted by checking even multiple times a day, what developers can do with it, and we’re off to a great start, a beginning of a cold war of App Stores.\n","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2020/appsrevolution/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all started back in 2007, when the iPhone went public.

Wake up, cook, eat, zooming, exercise(ish), sleep, repeat. That’s what everyone’s doing, besides the heroes that are keeping us alive in hospitals, grocery stores and research centers.\nWe, all together rediscovered the beauty of baking, spending more quality time with our own families, partaking our creativity beyond our four-boxed home walls to break all together this awful boredom to those invisible fences that this pandemic raised. There’s a beauty behind it, underneath this awful situation darker than our past WW fights some might say: we’re living an unprecedented time, nothing as big as this happened in history and we’re learning, learning to be more decent human beings, not only with ourselves but for our beautiful planet I like to call home as well. We are learning to remove all this clutter we created with innovation in the past decades. Hopefully when all this will be history we will not forget what it means to be united, to fight and live for shared ideals such as repairing this environmental mess we made, or by having simpler meaningful lives like every one of us used to be blessed with. Soon enough all of this will be over, we’ll win the battle like we always did for everything, but we just need to hold tight and do our own little part: everybody, unified.\nFor one reason or another I’ve been living in the Philippines for nearly seven months and counting now with my love and his amazing family. I’ve had so many amazing unrepeatable experiences that I wouldn’t trade for anything in this world, I feel like I’m the luckiest person alive. Now I’m stuck here for who knows how long, every state in the world keeps on extending their own strict quarantines, which I don’t really mind, I do LOVE to be able to live with my better half, waking up next to him every single day is the dreamiest of dreams, but not working enhanced my depression making an awful gloomy comeback. Lorenzo is really not the kind of person capable of staying home doing unproductive chores, so I need to get back to work as soon as the situation allows, also because funds and UK permit are about to expire.\nI dream of living with my partner, and we’ll get there, sadly we need to go back to long distance for a while once again and that will surely break both of our hearts, but who’s favorite story lacks following a bit of drama? I want to be able to walk with my camera laced on my arm, ready to capture whatever my eye tells me to frame, I want to hug my parents and grandparents, I want to go out and eat pizza with them again (yes, ok, I’m Italian), I want to travel, I want to have a family, I’ve so many amazing things to do before I will farewell this reality and I cannot wait to be able to start with something all over again.\nKeep up and stay safe everyone in the meantime,\nLove,\nLorenzo.\n","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2020/abreakfromlife/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow everyone’s doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, it’s been a while since our last blog-chat and I would be lying if I say I was busy, I’ve been not busy at all in the past few months, let’s just say drowsy and with many thoughts in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Break From Life"}]
