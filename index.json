And, oh boy if that is F A S T !\nIt means that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to rely on a server requesting queries from a database to build an html page on the fly every time a user requests for it, that page has already been built for everyone prior the pushed updates, and ready to be downloaded to your screen.\nThe only hassle is for the developer, those static pages thingy is a nerdy process to manage, but worth it for who views the content. The cms (call it how you want it) is in your computer terminal instead of it being online, so you cannot easily switch machine to update your website, you need to do one or more steps before having that, and also is not that possible uploading an article with the iPhone.\nSo, my protocol with updates will be:\n I can start writing articles on a markdown app like Znote or iA Writer on any of my devices, later or, when ready for submission, I can easily write three terminal commands on my main workstation to upload those written pages.  There are two more steps on the way, but I don\u0026rsquo;t mind since I gained: the simplicity of writing posts using markdown instead of HTML, and the huge speed-boost switching from a database powered hosting to just files based hosting.\nI cannot wait to get started on this new journey of mine, and you to be part of.

It shoved the path of our modern smartphones, creating a closed and safe environment for all of its users with what we always knew as iOS. It was and it still is a little bit too guarded, a little bit too sealed for signor computer scientists used to a machine like Windows, Mac or Linux, where they have full freedom to control over the operating system with countless possibilities for customization and script/app developments.\nIt was inevitable.\nIf you create an enclosed and safe environment some people are always going to find ways to break in-n-out of it, for no particular reason but to gain the reassurance of being the one who is still being in control having a sort of independence. I get it, we all want to customize our devices as we please but Apple made that hard to their customers for mixed reasons, and no wonder why is still one of the tech companies with the best customer satisfaction. Look at Android for instance, you can install it literally everywhere, but at the finale developers struggle to keep up with all of its devices that often ends in either have to test their apps on every possible gadget, leading to consume lots of team resources, or that their app that might not be fully compatible for all of its users, leaving many unexpected bugs and crashes behind.\nSo, Revolution it is. Fortnite didn‚Äôt started it, it was just a sparkle that made the fire stronger. Cydia and Jailbreaks were the pioneers of it, then there was that amazing app called Delta that never made it to the App Store because of its strict guidelines, so people found ways to install it anyways, App Store or not.\nDespite the fact that iOS is still not as customizable as a Mac, and no intention from Apple to merge the two, we have many different options to: buy, install or create our own cool apps that Apple won‚Äôt allow releasing on its own store. We have Shortcuts, you can play around for pretty much everything with them, then TestFlight Apple‚Äôs own app that makes possible for developers to distribute their apps prior the debut to the App Store for the sole scope to let users beta test their algorithms. And with TestFlight another indie App Store was born, a place where every app is free and not fully overseen by the App Store big eyes (aka strict guidelines), so now developers have even more control on their creations with Airport.\nAs a user you have to submit a request to join their TestFlight beta (that is beta just for incognito reasons at Apple) and you‚Äôre all in. I‚Äôve been personally addicted by checking even multiple times a day, what developers can do with it, and we‚Äôre off to a great start, a beginning of a cold war of App Stores.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2020/appsrevolution/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all started back in 2007, when the iPhone went public.

Trying the best to share the good with the positive, and leave the bad aside, to make your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù kind of jealous, to make others engage with your wonderful memories, so to feel a little bit less left behind from this crazy lonely society we all built.

I was having the time of my life, exponentially exploding of happiness by all of the positive loving vibes I was surrounded by with each day that passed it, and it was never meant to come to an end, but let‚Äôs keep up by saying to a pause. Cause the period I‚Äôm in now it‚Äôll pass, it has to. I live to work, I wake up to work, I want to ban weekends to work 5/5 days, even if what I do is a job that doesn‚Äôt satisfy me, a job that makes me worthless, a job that I wish nobody would ever do in my position with all of my dreams. I want all of this so time will go quicker, quicker than ever to reach few months in the future from now, when I will finally spend the rest of my life with the man I am truly and deeply in Love with.\nJumping back to the topic of what these three weeks were and why I didn‚Äôt post much around, well .. We traveled all across Malaysia, explored another mesmerising spot in the Philippines with all of his loving family and lost ourselves in the magical Singaporean land. It was the time we were both anxiously waiting for six long depressing months, and then me made it, being together again, best travel and life buddies.\nThe first week and a half was a bit of waiting for our trips to happen, but still we did some memorable and new stuff too, exploring for me a bit more of the amazing Filipino culture I now feel fully immersed in. The second weekend was spent in an amazing beach spot in south Negros known as Sipalay: a beach surrounded by mountains .. I know, I didn‚Äôt understand it either up until I‚Äôve seen it with my eyes, and everyone should experience that because it was gorgeous. Moving on we took a flight to Singapore, a country new for both of us, where we could really start to be truly explorers for the first time together .. Here we did and explored all sort of things, and photoshoots after another we landed to the Universal Studios where we tried the thrill of not one, but two of the highest interlaced roller coasters in the world, it was crazy but fun. Then Palau Ubin, an island where we could have seen the real Singapore of the 50s and getting lost with our rented bikes on the trail paths of this island. And how to forget this, we even have been feeling rich for a night in the forbidden Marina Bay Sands infinity pool, still crazy to think that we have made it.\nFrom Singapore we tried also for a night the less hotter yet still great city of Malaysia known as Kuala Lumpur, I‚Äôve been back to the amazing Batu Caves where this time I could have really seen the beauty of it by getting lost with our eyes in the colourful steps and temples that they redecorated thorough these couple of years.\nWe had the time of our lives again, and we cannot wait to have countless more starting by the end of this year, just stick with us, is gonna be great!

As I was using Filmborn as one of my main editing apps on my iPhone, I‚Äôve been looking through this tag as well to see what creators using the same editing software were sharing; and one of this photos that I hearted changed my life in a way I would never have imagined.

And to think that it all started by a like of a random tag on a random photo sharing platform, it‚Äôs something quite incredible, or as someone would say: destiny. So we started exchanging messages, and video calls for then not being able to think a life without us, so we fell in love. But it was all on the internet, in this gigantic imaginary cloud that connects us to this huge home we‚Äôre living called Earth, in such wise it was only logical to take a step forward. Therefor we planned our first meet in person with a travel around Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand; but for some diabolical black forces beyond our control, our plan we had been dying to do miserably failed, but we didn‚Äôt give up, in fact our love grew stronger than ever.

Another nice memory I have about this snowfall, is walking around the Abney cemetery, it was so incredible discovering it under a much brighter and quieter perspective, felt kind of like strolling into a mystical movie set.\nOh yeah, how I could I forget that, just yesterday I hopped on a train to Richmond, in hoping to see more snow than it were in East London, but I was wrong, everywhere it was already melting ‚Ä¶ Too far, too late. But the remarkable landscapes of this place are always entertainingly restful, so I walked and chilled through the now muddy paths of what I like to think as the Avalon of London.\nBut that‚Äôs enough Emma, really, thanks, we all had a good time, but please let us enjoy what it should be next, while mr.

These are the mixed emotions that I usually feel every time I reach the end of something I do, follow or be.\nToday I‚Äôm feeling all of that over again, so I‚Äôm happy, but at the same time sad. I‚Äôm writing you from my last day of my Chia vacation, here in Sardinia, while looking at the gorgeous beaches surrounded by nothing more than beauty, it‚Äôs hard, very hard to say farewell to that. But is in days like these that I have to try my best to enjoy the journey, every little moment of today might be missed ‚Äòcause of my stupid misery to think about the near future: what would happen tomorrow? Would I make it to the ferryboat back home? Would I miss it? Would I reach land? Would I still be alive and not dying from a sinking old boat or by a meteorite hitting Earth? These seems way too out of line of thoughts, but that‚Äôs what my mind does, I told you before, I am a messed up of a man.\nIn any way I should at least try, try to set my mind free from this obstructive ideas, and I‚Äôm actually figuring out that writing this piece isn‚Äôt helping at all. Let‚Äôs try to unfold my emotions then, so that the problem of my sadness could be analyzed and hopefully fixed. I‚Äôm sad, sad of leaving a place I‚Äôve been living for nearly three weeks, three weeks are a lot, I just settled here, and suddenly I‚Äôve got to leave? Leave for then re-settle elsewhere? Why? What‚Äôs the point of doing that now? Give me a break changing future!\nI‚Äôm a creature of habits, I love going to bed after sunset and waking up before sunrise, and I do a sort of ritual every night that my sister would laugh and joke around about it, so change is always difficult for me, I don‚Äôt know where my life is going to be leading me tomorrow, and I‚Äôm hell scared the out of it! Of course I‚Äôm gonna be back at my birthplace, uploading and sorting gigabytes and gigabytes of photos captured during these three weeks from my lovely 27‚Äù iMac, and why not, also from my past south-Asian trip I recently took, but what then? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll figure something out to do, like I always did, but not knowing it NOW, makes me frightened.\nHymn To The Sand\n  Oh pure beaches,\n dwarf pebbles made out of shells,\n sea creatures,\n rocks.\n  you‚Äôll be missed.\n  like the ocean‚Äôs missing land\n waiting for a comeback\n a waving rejoin to ground.\n Change alone doesn‚Äôt make me sad, there‚Äôs also lots of melancholy going on today. All of the memories I‚Äôve been shared and created with three awesome people, people that made this trip a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable, yes, indeed, you settled in one of the happiest place of my mind as long as I‚Äôll remember, and I‚Äôll always be thankful for that.\nNow the happier part, I don‚Äôt want to make you all the way down, let‚Äôs conclude by boosting our moods up a bit, the last few paragraphs were very gloomy. Luckily, the other side of my mind thinks that a journey is good, no matter where this will lead me to, or what the cruising vehicle would be, a conveyance is always a great way to change things for the better.\nI LOVE taking airplanes (even though that‚Äôs not the case), trains, boats, even driving a cheap bad looking car, as long as that would made me hop on a long journey. The loving part I think is the unpredictability of what a whatever the crossing would be. Getting out there and look at things differently, that always fascinated me.\nOn an airplane you‚Äôve got to see earth from a different perspective; on a ground mean of transport streets and roads and landscapes you never thought would existed; and on a boat cruising water, incredible horizons filled with one of a kind sunrises and sunsets, with why not, a greet from some dolphins on the way. I can‚Äôt stop telling you that I love it, I love it so much, so let me go now, my mind is on a-bit-of-a-hurry, but first a last dip into the sea, to make this, a day to be sealed in one of my glorious memories.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2017/lastday/","summary":"Sadness, relief, melancholy, happiness; and again, sorrow.

Well, there‚Äôre a few reasons why ‚Ä¶ Many people around me guessed that I did it because of the recent outcome from the World Health Organization that eating too much meat could be dangerous for our health, but I ain‚Äôt done it because of that, I usually eat everything no matter what the impact on my body is as far as makes me feel happy\nThe main reason that pushed me forward in that direction is because I care so much about environment and our beautiful planet, so I‚Äôd like to do as much as I could to leave the world better that I found it. To produce just one pound of meat are required over 8 pounds of feed and 8K liters of water, for not talking about the carbon footprint that ground farms have on our planet, making climate change even worse.

Flickr). I also tried to use for the first time the new app called: ‚ÄòStorie‚Äô for share my travel experiences in almost real-time (if you know the app you can follow me @lorenzoviolone and re-watch the videos if you wish).\nHere‚Äôs what I did:\nDay 1 This is the day where I flew from FCO (Rome) to BCN (Barcelona) through an airplane. The two hours flight was pretty good: I enjoyed the view, listened to music and played around with some photos on the VSCOcam app.\nWe arrived by evening at 4PM, and we hurried up to the hotel for checking in our room for then jumped to the first part of the city that we wished to visit by sunset. As usual, we spent some time figuring out the tickets at the train station, and so ‚Ä¶ we missed the sunset.\nEven if we missed it, we had a nice walk in a port zone called ‚ÄúPort Vel‚Äù and the famous ‚ÄúRambla‚Äù. Port Vel is amazing, if you ever get a chance to visit Barcelona you cannot miss this place, is very suggestive by night with all the lights of the bridge that took us to the Maremagnum shopping center (an amazing little mall surrounded by the sea).\nFor end the day, we stopped by a market through the Rambla street where we bought some food to eat at our hotel.\nDay 2 We had a bright start of the day back to Port Vel for breakfast at Starbucks with an amazing view of the port (yes, I‚Äôm a big fan of Starbucks), we ordered a couple of american coffee with two choco chip cookies, I couldn‚Äôt wished more!\nThen we headed to the Barceloneta beach by walk ‚Ä¶ this place is stellar! Very peaceful and beautiful, with a lot of surfers/skaters/bikers and peoples that just wanted to enjoy their morning in the best way. Again, you cannot miss Barceloneta beach too, is extremely gorgeous! We also took some time here for capturing everything with our cameras.\nAfter that, we jumped to the most important landmark of the entire Spain also known as the greatest unfinished work of Antonio Gaudi, yes, I‚Äôm talking about the Sagrada Familia.\nIs useless to say that was the most amazing basilica that I ever seen in my entire life (St. Peter in Vatican city, included), this building is breathtaking ‚Ä¶ When I first entered I had goosebumps all over my body, I was surprised of how beautiful it was this stunning church.\nThe thing that I liked most of it was the simplicity of the interior colors mixed with the foolish great architecture, you know, when you enter to St. Peter you first noticed that there‚Äôs a lot of gold, but there you don‚Äôt, looking around you‚Äôd see a lot of white and a lot of stunning colors created by the sun rays through the amazing windows.\nThen we went back to the end of Barceloneta beach for lunch (we fell in love with this place), and we saw a group of people playing Quidditch (we guessed) on the sand. We eaten some tapas (little wonderful dishes of food) right next to the beach.\nAfter lunch we headed over Parc Guell for capture the sunset, this time we made it :) Was an amazing park with a stunning skyline view of the city, with also a lot of Gaudi‚Äôs works.\nRight after sunset, we wanted to see the famous magic fountain of Barcelona, so, we took the subway and we came to Placa Espanya but unfortunately the fountain was closed, so, we opted for a mall called Las Arenas for dinner.\nHere we eaten a couple of sandwiches with the traditional chocolate and churros, basically an hot chocolate with some bread fried sticks, a delicious!\nThen, we headed back to the hotel for sleep, we had a wonderful day!\nDay 3 Sadly was the last day, and for cheering us up we went to Starbucks again for breakfast (unfortunately where we live Starbucks doesn‚Äôt exist yet, so we take advantage of it on every travel we do). I took again another great american coffee, but this time with some pancakes.\nThen we jumped to the Apple Store Passeig de Gr√†cia (amazing one), and walked in direction to Casa Batllo and Casa mila.\nArrived at destination, we discovered that both of the Casa were a lot expensive, more than the ticket for the Sagrada Familia, so, we just photographed these outside.\nThen, we went to a famous shop in Spain like Harrods in UK or La Rinascente in IT, called: ‚ÄúLa Corte Ingles‚Äù. We had fun discovering every floor of it :)\nAfter that, we walked again around the Rambla zone in direction to the Maremagnum shopping center, where we had a wonderful paella for lunch and we also did some shopping.\nWe did some last-minute shopping üòÑ | @29_franci pic.twitter.com/O8tAW6tZbH\n\u0026mdash; Lorenzo Viola (@lorenzoviolone) January 29, 2015  Then we headed back to the hotel for collecting our suitcases and going to the airport back to Rome.\nIn these three days we had a wonderful time in this beautiful modern city of Spain that I easily recommend to everyone exploring.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2015/whatithinkaboutbarcelona/","summary":"In the past week I travelled around the city of Barcelona, Spain, with my lovely sister francesca2910, I did a lot of photos that I still have to upload around (you know ..
