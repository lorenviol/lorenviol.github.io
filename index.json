Gosh that was a pretty depressing blog post, if you made it until the end I am ok, I’ll be back in a few with a more enthusiastic story,\n love you all,\n Lorenzo.\n","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2021/happyunhappy/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA new year has already begun, leaving us the unspeakable past behind and a whole fresh one to live enjoy and experience.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"HappyUnhappy"},{"content":"It all started back in 2007, when the iPhone went public. It shoved the path of our modern smartphones, creating a closed and safe environment for all of its users with what we always knew as iOS. It was and it still is a little bit too guarded, a little bit too sealed for signor computer scientists used to a machine like Windows, Mac or Linux, where they have full freedom to control over the operating system with countless possibilities for customization and script/app developments.\nIt was inevitable.\nIf you create an enclosed and safe environment some people are always going to find ways to break in-n-out of it, for no particular reason but to gain the reassurance of being the one who is still being in control having a sort of independence. I get it, we all want to customize our devices as we please but Apple made that hard to their customers for mixed reasons, and no wonder why is still one of the tech companies with the best customer satisfaction. Look at Android for instance, you can install it literally everywhere, but at the finale developers struggle to keep up with all of its devices that often ends in either have to test their apps on every possible gadget, leading to consume lots of team resources, or that their app that might not be fully compatible for all of its users, leaving many unexpected bugs and crashes behind.\nSo, Revolution it is. Fortnite didn’t started it, it was just a sparkle that made the fire stronger. Cydia and Jailbreaks were the pioneers of it, then there was that amazing app called Delta that never made it to the App Store because of its strict guidelines, so people found ways to install it anyways, App Store or not.\nDespite the fact that iOS is still not as customizable as a Mac, and no intention from Apple to merge the two, we have many different options to: buy, install or create our own cool apps that Apple won’t allow releasing on its own store. We have Shortcuts, you can play around for pretty much everything with them, then TestFlight Apple’s own app that makes possible for developers to distribute their apps prior the debut to the App Store for the sole scope to let users beta test their algorithms. And with TestFlight another indie App Store was born, a place where every app is free and not fully overseen by the App Store big eyes (aka strict guidelines), so now developers have even more control on their creations with Airport.\nAs a user you have to submit a request to join their TestFlight beta (that is beta just for incognito reasons at Apple) and you’re all in. I’ve been personally addicted by checking even multiple times a day, what developers can do with it, and we’re off to a great start, a beginning of a cold war of App Stores.\n","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2020/appsrevolution/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all started back in 2007, when the iPhone went public.

Wake up, cook, eat, zooming, exercise(ish), sleep, repeat. That’s what everyone’s doing, besides the heroes that are keeping us alive in hospitals, grocery stores and research centers.\nWe, all together rediscovered the beauty of baking, spending more quality time with our own families, partaking our creativity beyond our four-boxed home walls to break all together this awful boredom to those invisible fences that this pandemic raised. There’s a beauty behind it, underneath this awful situation darker than our past WW fights some might say: we’re living an unprecedented time, nothing as big as this happened in history and we’re learning, learning to be more decent human beings, not only with ourselves but for our beautiful planet I like to call home as well. We are learning to remove all this clutter we created with innovation in the past decades. Hopefully when all this will be history we will not forget what it means to be united, to fight and live for shared ideals such as repairing this environmental mess we made, or by having simpler meaningful lives like every one of us used to be blessed with. Soon enough all of this will be over, we’ll win the battle like we always did for everything, but we just need to hold tight and do our own little part: everybody, unified.\nFor one reason or another I’ve been living in the Philippines for nearly seven months and counting now with my love and his amazing family. I’ve had so many amazing unrepeatable experiences that I wouldn’t trade for anything in this world, I feel like I’m the luckiest person alive. Now I’m stuck here for who knows how long, every state in the world keeps on extending their own strict quarantines, which I don’t really mind, I do LOVE to be able to live with my better half, waking up next to him every single day is the dreamiest of dreams, but not working enhanced my depression making an awful gloomy comeback. Lorenzo is really not the kind of person capable of staying home doing unproductive chores, so I need to get back to work as soon as the situation allows, also because funds and UK permit are about to expire.\nI dream of living with my partner, and we’ll get there, sadly we need to go back to long distance for a while once again and that will surely break both of our hearts, but who’s favorite story lacks following a bit of drama? I want to be able to walk with my camera laced on my arm, ready to capture whatever my eye tells me to frame, I want to hug my parents and grandparents, I want to go out and eat pizza with them again (yes, ok, I’m Italian), I want to travel, I want to have a family, I’ve so many amazing things to do before I will farewell this reality and I cannot wait to be able to start with something all over again.\nKeep up and stay safe everyone in the meantime,\nLove,\nLorenzo.\n","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2020/abreakfromlife/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow everyone’s doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, it’s been a while since our last blog-chat and I would be lying if I say I was busy, I’ve been not busy at all in the past few months, let’s just say drowsy and with many thoughts in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Break From Life"},{"content":"I recently got back in London from another memorable adventure in East Asia with my Love, and to be honest I haven’t been posting much of it ever since, so I will try to fix this starting today.\nIs so true, when you’re having the time of your life you forget about all of this social media stuff that makes you want to post more and more when you’re all alone in a city miles away from your significant others. Posting to feel good, while empty inside. Trying the best to share the good with the positive, and leave the bad aside, to make your “friends” kind of jealous, to make others engage with your wonderful memories, so to feel a little bit less left behind from this crazy lonely society we all built. Is crazy, but is also true, at least for my lonely depressing life that is in that black hole of a city I attracted myself in.\nSo I was happy .. Wait .. What am I saying? .. I .. I was having the time of my life, exponentially exploding of happiness by all of the positive loving vibes I was surrounded by with each day that passed it, and it was never meant to come to an end, but let’s keep up by saying to a pause. Cause the period I’m in now it’ll pass, it has to. I live to work, I wake up to work, I want to ban weekends to work 5/5 days, even if what I do is a job that doesn’t satisfy me, a job that makes me worthless, a job that I wish nobody would ever do in my position with all of my dreams. I want all of this so time will go quicker, quicker than ever to reach few months in the future from now, when I will finally spend the rest of my life with the man I am truly and deeply in Love with.\nJumping back to the topic of what these three weeks were and why I didn’t post much around, well .. We traveled all across Malaysia, explored another mesmerising spot in the Philippines with all of his loving family and lost ourselves in the magical Singaporean land. It was the time we were both anxiously waiting for six long depressing months, and then me made it, being together again, best travel and life buddies.\nThe first week and a half was a bit of waiting for our trips to happen, but still we did some memorable and new stuff too, exploring for me a bit more of the amazing Filipino culture I now feel fully immersed in. The second weekend was spent in an amazing beach spot in south Negros known as Sipalay: a beach surrounded by mountains .. I know, I didn’t understand it either up until I’ve seen it with my eyes, and everyone should experience that because it was gorgeous. Moving on we took a flight to Singapore, a country new for both of us, where we could really start to be truly explorers for the first time together .. Here we did and explored all sort of things, and photoshoots after another we landed to the Universal Studios where we tried the thrill of not one, but two of the highest interlaced roller coasters in the world, it was crazy but fun. Then Palau Ubin, an island where we could have seen the real Singapore of the 50s and getting lost with our rented bikes on the trail paths of this island. And how to forget this, we even have been feeling rich for a night in the forbidden Marina Bay Sands infinity pool, still crazy to think that we have made it.\nFrom Singapore we tried also for a night the less hotter yet still great city of Malaysia known as Kuala Lumpur, I’ve been back to the amazing Batu Caves where this time I could have really seen the beauty of it by getting lost with our eyes in the colourful steps and temples that they redecorated thorough these couple of years.\nWe had the time of our lives again, and we cannot wait to have countless more starting by the end of this year, just stick with us, is gonna be great! For now here’s a video of our recent second adventure, I hope it will make you feel a glimpse of enjoyment as much as we did.\nUntil next time internet,\nyour Lorenzo.\n ","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2019/nopostsequalsbesttime/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently got back in London from another memorable adventure in East Asia with my Love, and to be honest I haven’t been posting much of it ever since, so I will try to fix this starting today.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Posts Equals Best Time"},{"content":"I should have probably have written this sooner, but with life and work, here I am doing it now. More than a month has already passed from the incredible travel I had in the Philippines, and I can’t stop telling you how much I would love to go back, especially with this crazy, freezing, rainy, depressing London weather. It’s been twenty eight memorable days of incredible experiences, not just like been traveling, but being completely immersed into the Filipino culture.\nBut I think I need to flashback you on this story for a second, or a paragraph 😉.\nTwo years ago, like currently, I was really into the Instagram game, and sometimes I casually spammed likes across strategically chosen hashtags in order to gain some likes and followers back. As I was using Filmborn as one of my main editing apps on my iPhone, I’ve been looking through this tag as well to see what creators using the same editing software were sharing; and one of this photos that I hearted changed my life in a way I would never have imagined. By liking this picture I met the best person I will ever know, and eventually, fell in love with him. And to think that it all started by a like of a random tag on a random photo sharing platform, it’s something quite incredible, or as someone would say: destiny. So we started exchanging messages, and video calls for then not being able to think a life without us, so we fell in love. But it was all on the internet, in this gigantic imaginary cloud that connects us to this huge home we’re living called Earth, in such wise it was only logical to take a step forward. Therefor we planned our first meet in person with a travel around Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand; but for some diabolical black forces beyond our control, our plan we had been dying to do miserably failed, but we didn’t give up, in fact our love grew stronger than ever. After two years we’ve been able to remake our plan, and this time we made it! We finally met! Traveling together in one of the best countries I’ve been lucky enough to visit: the Philippines.\nI don’t even know where to start to share the many beautiful memorable moments we had. I’ve been meeting the love of my life, his family, his gorgeous Avalon, I’m so grateful and blessed for all it. What I only wish now is for time to go faster, faster than ever until the day we are meeting again.\n","permalink":"https://lorenviol.github.io/posts/2018/amonth-withpalanggako/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI should have probably have written this sooner, but with life and work, here I am doing it now.\nMore than a month has already passed from the incredible travel I had in the Philippines, and I can’t stop telling you how much I would love to go back, especially with this crazy, freezing, rainy, depressing London weather.\nIt’s been twenty eight memorable days of incredible experiences, not just like been traveling, but being completely immersed into the Filipino culture.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Month with Palangga Ko"},{"content":"Another month is passing by like nothing happened, faster than a blink of an eye, but a lot had happened. It’s odd, isn’t it? Having our minds always running into the present simple makes us forget all we had done so far this year, and it’s damn scary … Damn scary 2019 is just another wink away.\nThese days are getting on so fast too quickly, and in a way I’m happy. So many different things changed since I’m living here in the UK, the country I had dreamt to be and now I am.\nI found a job, my first (ok actually second, or third) ever job, and so far I’m loving it, for all the awesome work mates around me. I’m living alone which is not a bad thing, but it kills me that is half a planet away from my other half, my family and friends. This day, thirty first of August has so many different connotations, it used to be sad with the school period restarting, is also a period of change, and the end of my favorite month: Summer.\nBut don’t you worry Summer, I’m coming, chasing back on you, in fact soon enough I’ll be on a plane flying towards Dubai and then the Philippines where I’ll be spending an entire month, and I can’t help myself but having my head over heels.

A spark of vintage goodness, lighting his way up to a roll filled with chemicals in a black box for literally fractions of a second. A black box itself indeed, enclosed surprises reviled only hours, if not days after the actual action of releasing the shutter. And that’s the beauty of it; nowadays we’re so used to have everything, everywhere, at any moment of our lives, acknowledging an immediate result faster than our brain could even process it. Therefor, an escape to our crazy fast moving world is needed. A present that is always running, running away from a past that we just lived, a past so little that blends into the present itself; so this, this setback allows us to put things in perspective.\nThe joy when finally the day comes, it feels like a Christmas morning, and that lost feeling is one of the greatest of all.\nThat’s how I love to think about film cameras, the knowing and at the same time not knowing of what a picture you just made is. Kind of like the Schrodinger’s cat paradox, applied into our amazing photography world.\nSo it started, few weeks ago I decided to go out for a walk in East London with only one camera, and that was my beloved film Yashica FX-3, loaded with an expired Ilford HP5.\nAn area of London I wasn’t aware of it yet, a great place for lots of photographic inspirations … Industrial design mingled with futuristic cityscapes, how could have I missed this spot for so long? I am such a huge fan of industrial design abandoned kinda places, and yet it got me full surprised of what I found by the Thames barrier, in a city I was convinced to know every sight of.\nA great walking discovery of 19 shots, that I hope y’all will enjoy.
