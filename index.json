[{"content":"Hey there,\nit\u0026rsquo;s been a long while since the last time I wrote something on my blog, and lots of things have happened since. Life has gotten real, the dog days I used to rely on are defenitely over, and I am happier than ever.\nOn this long twentynine years journey I had called life, I\u0026rsquo;ve been experimenting in search for some kind of purpose that I might have, spoiler alert: still looking. I remember that time I have lived in London for two years, it was pure experimentation: my first real job, first moving out, hands on a first real test of what adulthood looks and feel. I recall loving it. Indipendence is an undescribable feeling, it makes you a human with superpowers, everything could go disastrously wrong or incredibly well. On that adventure I learned a lot, and I certainly miss some aspects of it, most of all the people I met in that beatiful and hectic metropolis.\nBut things don\u0026rsquo;t last forever, change is part of our existence, it is scary yet a reality we have to face. On that journey I had, I made an unconsious desicion of following an unknown path, the path of Love. I promised to myself to not be on a LDR (Long Distance Relationship) anymore, so I moved to the Philippines, to bring Love home. A series of things then happened, bad occoruances that made me had to stay in the city of smiles a little longer than expected, but that made me even better. It shaped my existence into something I never thought I could reach.\nFast forward to 2021, I got married. I feel the luckiest man in the universe, is truly unrepresentable as a feeling, is when your mind goes: that\u0026rsquo;s it, I\u0026rsquo;ve made it! Months and tons of burocracy later, me and my husband moved to Ireland. We booked that flight without a job or even a place to stay (and that was so streessful). We luckly got a house just a week prior after months and months of looking, I never though it was that of a mission to find a house, room or pretty much anything in this island. But at the end thank God we found it. And that was the beginning of what I thought could never in my dreams happen. As soon as we got here, I was about to accept a mediocre job again, as we needed an income as soon as possible. I have to thank my husband for not taking those jobs, I could never repay him for that, it\u0026rsquo;s been the best desicion I ever made in a long time, the one to keep the FAITH and BELIEF on getting hired in a company that I truly love.\nThe day came, when they interviewed me, I still couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking to punch myself to check if I was sleeping. I was not. Dreams, yes, dreams do really come true. You just need a little bit of luck by a lovely leprechaun and lots of belief. It\u0026rsquo;s a great combo that will make you the happiest you haver been. Right place, right time: I can\u0026rsquo;t wait where this route will bring me. Right now I am crunked to keep traveling on this CLOUD-NINE path.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviol.one/posts/2022/dreamsdocometrue/","summary":"Hey there,\nit\u0026rsquo;s been a long while since the last time I wrote something on my blog, and lots of things have happened since.

Two years forward there we were when we first met in the Philippines. It was insanely amazing, meeting the person I was dying to meet, it finally happened! After that trip we did not want to say goodbye, and is after that trip back in 2018 that we started making plans for our future.\nWe had (still have on our plan) New Zealand in our minds but for allowing him to meet my family as well and vice versa, we opted to meet again in Italy. At that time I was working in the UK completely alone, and him in his country with his family. That made me wanting to see him so badly every single minute of the day, if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t working I was mentally destroyed \u0026hellip; Weekends were my deepest enemy, they killed me softly every hour I wasn\u0026rsquo;t occupied.\nWork.\nDuring that time work was my best friend, where I luckily had amazing colleagues to keep me going through those rough patches of my existence.\nEnough of depressing memories. Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our plan to meet again, oh yes, we so did after few months. This time I made the call buying a ticket as soon as I could take some time off work. Therefor we travelled together from the Philippines to Singapore and Malaysia, but still not a chance for our Italian plan.\nAfter this trip everything changed again, the plan was clearer then ever, so we focused our every single energy on making it to Italy.\nIt was 2019, so yes. It did not work.\nFirst rejection of the Italian visa, was a bullet straight in our hearts. I got the news on a quick 5-min break that my colleagues kindly gave me. Coming back I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even move a finger, I was devastated. I weren\u0026rsquo;t able to work as fully as usual: I couldn\u0026rsquo;t breathe, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t laugh on my colleagues jokes, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go on with the rest of the day. It was a hard step back we both had to face.\nFew weeks had been passed, but I still couldn\u0026rsquo;t accept that failure, I had to do something.\nI made one of the greatest and most difficult decisions of my entire life: I chose to follow my heart and put aside the business part of it. My off-days were over, I had to leave my job. I was on a heart rescue mission: my other half of my body was missing and I had to find it again.\nSo I went back to the Philippines, oh gosh, it was so good to see him again, the butterflies came back right where I left \u0026rsquo;em, smitten than ever. This time I was on a mission: we both promised to ourselves to not leave each other until this visa will be approved, because we both knew that one way or another it had to.\nSo we did flew back to Cebu for our appointment to give all the required documents to an embassy office, anxiously waiting and boom. Another huge devastating news. And when you think there isn\u0026rsquo;t anything worse that could happen, life hits, stabbing you in the back with other shitty unfortunate events. It was indeed a very rough time for him, and so me.\nI decided to not going anywhere without him, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t leave him in that state, nobody would have.\nFast forward 2021 we decided to dust off the documents, revising everything, and flying to Manila in a pandemic era for submitting those documents once again. It was the first time since I came back in the Philippines that we took an airplane, it was a bit unusual but we got the hang of the idea of traveling again, we were happy. While the files were being revised by the embassy of Italy, we flew few islands south back home.\nThe wait wasn\u0026rsquo;t long, after 15 days a postman came in our subdivision, there was a letter for him. That was it! We were both super scared to open it as we noticed a paper inside, and if there is a paper inside it we knew it would probably be the rejection reasons.\nWe were wrong!\nTears of joy came out on both of our eyes, grandmother couldn\u0026rsquo;t believe it either, we were laughing, hugging each others in tears: the visa was on his passport!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t realize it even days after, it was literally UNREAL. Finally our huge sacrifices were worth the chase!\nAfter two years of living together in his motherland Philippines, we can finally move on and start a wonderful new chapter of our lives, were we cannot wait to put that damn ink on paper.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re so excited to show you!\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviol.one/posts/2021/ishappening/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been a rough couple of years, many things have happened and many things have changed for pretty much everybody, but for us this story starts a little bit differently.\nIt all began by a spawn of a like on one of his IG photos (this one), we then started exchanging messages.

And, oh boy if that is F A S T !\nIt means that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to rely on a server requesting queries from a database to build an html page on the fly every time a user requests for it, that page has already been built for everyone prior the pushed updates, and ready to be downloaded to your screen.\nThe only hassle is for the developer, those static pages thingy is a nerdy process to manage, but worth it for who views the content. The cms (call it how you want it) is in your computer terminal instead of it being online, so you cannot easily switch machine to update your website, you need to do one or more steps before having that, and also is not that possible uploading an article with the iPhone.\nSo, my protocol with updates will be:\nI can start writing articles on a markdown app like Znote or iA Writer on any of my devices, later or, when ready for submission, I can easily write three terminal commands on my main workstation to upload those written pages. There are two more steps on the way, but I don\u0026rsquo;t mind since I gained: the simplicity of writing posts using markdown instead of HTML, and the huge speed-boost switching from a database powered hosting to just files based hosting.\nI cannot wait to get started on this new journey of mine, and you to be part of.

It shoved the path of our modern smartphones, creating a closed and safe environment for all of its users with what we always knew as iOS. It was and it still is a little bit too guarded, a little bit too sealed for signor computer scientists used to a machine like Windows, Mac or Linux, where they have full freedom to control over the operating system with countless possibilities for customization and script/app developments.\nIt was inevitable.\nIf you create an enclosed and safe environment some people are always going to find ways to break in-n-out of it, for no particular reason but to gain the reassurance of being the one who is still being in control having a sort of independence. I get it, we all want to customize our devices as we please but Apple made that hard to their customers for mixed reasons, and no wonder why is still one of the tech companies with the best customer satisfaction. Look at Android for instance, you can install it literally everywhere, but at the finale developers struggle to keep up with all of its devices that often ends in either have to test their apps on every possible gadget, leading to consume lots of team resources, or that their app that might not be fully compatible for all of its users, leaving many unexpected bugs and crashes behind.\nSo, Revolution it is. Fortnite didn’t started it, it was just a sparkle that made the fire stronger. Cydia and Jailbreaks were the pioneers of it, then there was that amazing app called Delta that never made it to the App Store because of its strict guidelines, so people found ways to install it anyways, App Store or not.\nDespite the fact that iOS is still not as customizable as a Mac, and no intention from Apple to merge the two, we have many different options to: buy, install or create our own cool apps that Apple won’t allow releasing on its own store. We have Shortcuts, you can play around for pretty much everything with them, then TestFlight Apple’s own app that makes possible for developers to distribute their apps prior the debut to the App Store for the sole scope to let users beta test their algorithms. And with TestFlight another indie App Store was born, a place where every app is free and not fully overseen by the App Store big eyes (aka strict guidelines), so now developers have even more control on their creations with Airport.\nAs a user you have to submit a request to join their TestFlight beta (that is beta just for incognito reasons at Apple) and you’re all in.

Posting to feel good, while empty inside. Trying the best to share the good with the positive, and leave the bad aside, to make your “friends” kind of jealous, to make others engage with your wonderful memories, so to feel a little bit less left behind from this crazy lonely society we all built. Is crazy, but is also true, at least for my lonely depressing life that is in that black hole of a city I attracted myself in.\nSo I was happy .. Wait .. What am I saying? .. I .. I was having the time of my life, exponentially exploding of happiness by all of the positive loving vibes I was surrounded by with each day that passed it, and it was never meant to come to an end, but let’s keep up by saying to a pause. Cause the period I’m in now it’ll pass, it has to. I live to work, I wake up to work, I want to ban weekends to work 5/5 days, even if what I do is a job that doesn’t satisfy me, a job that makes me worthless, a job that I wish nobody would ever do in my position with all of my dreams. I want all of this so time will go quicker, quicker than ever to reach few months in the future from now, when I will finally spend the rest of my life with the man I am truly and deeply in Love with.\nJumping back to the topic of what these three weeks were and why I didn’t post much around, well .. We traveled all across Malaysia, explored another mesmerising spot in the Philippines with all of his loving family and lost ourselves in the magical Singaporean land. It was the time we were both anxiously waiting for six long depressing months, and then me made it, being together again, best travel and life buddies.\nThe first week and a half was a bit of waiting for our trips to happen, but still we did some memorable and new stuff too, exploring for me a bit more of the amazing Filipino culture I now feel fully immersed in. The second weekend was spent in an amazing beach spot in south Negros known as Sipalay: a beach surrounded by mountains .. I know, I didn’t understand it either up until I’ve seen it with my eyes, and everyone should experience that because it was gorgeous. Moving on we took a flight to Singapore, a country new for both of us, where we could really start to be truly explorers for the first time together .. Here we did and explored all sort of things, and photoshoots after another we landed to the Universal Studios where we tried the thrill of not one, but two of the highest interlaced roller coasters in the world, it was crazy but fun. Then Palau Ubin, an island where we could have seen the real Singapore of the 50s and getting lost with our rented bikes on the trail paths of this island. And how to forget this, we even have been feeling rich for a night in the forbidden Marina Bay Sands infinity pool, still crazy to think that we have made it.\nFrom Singapore we tried also for a night the less hotter yet still great city of Malaysia known as Kuala Lumpur, I’ve been back to the amazing Batu Caves where this time I could have really seen the beauty of it by getting lost with our eyes in the colourful steps and temples that they redecorated thorough these couple of years.\nWe had the time of our lives again, and we cannot wait to have countless more starting by the end of this year, just stick with us, is gonna be great!

As I was using Filmborn as one of my main editing apps on my iPhone, I’ve been looking through this tag as well to see what creators using the same editing software were sharing; and one of this photos that I hearted changed my life in a way I would never have imagined. By liking this picture I met the best person I will ever know, and eventually, fell in love with him. And to think that it all started by a like of a random tag on a random photo sharing platform, it’s something quite incredible, or as someone would say: destiny. So we started exchanging messages, and video calls for then not being able to think a life without us, so we fell in love. But it was all on the internet, in this gigantic imaginary cloud that connects us to this huge home we’re living called Earth, in such wise it was only logical to take a step forward. Therefor we planned our first meet in person with a travel around Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand; but for some diabolical black forces beyond our control, our plan we had been dying to do miserably failed, but we didn’t give up, in fact our love grew stronger than ever. After two years we’ve been able to remake our plan, and this time we made it! We finally met! Traveling together in one of the best countries I’ve been lucky enough to visit: the Philippines.\nI don’t even know where to start to share the many beautiful memorable moments we had. I’ve been meeting the love of my life, his family, his gorgeous Avalon, I’m so grateful and blessed for all it. What I only wish now is for time to go faster, faster than ever until the day we are meeting again.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviol.one/posts/2018/amonth-withpalanggako/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI should have probably have written this sooner, but with life and work, here I am doing it now.\nMore than a month has already passed from the incredible travel I had in the Philippines, and I can’t stop telling you how much I would love to go back, especially with this crazy, freezing, rainy, depressing London weather.\nIt’s been twenty eight memorable days of incredible experiences, not just like been traveling, but being completely immersed into the Filipino culture.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Month with Palangga Ko"},{"content":"Another month is passing by like nothing happened, faster than a blink of an eye, but a lot had happened.

These are the mixed emotions that I usually feel every time I reach the end of something I do, follow or be.\nToday I’m feeling all of that over again, so I’m happy, but at the same time sad. I’m writing you from my last day of my Chia vacation, here in Sardinia, while looking at the gorgeous beaches surrounded by nothing more than beauty, it’s hard, very hard to say farewell to that. But is in days like these that I have to try my best to enjoy the journey, every little moment of today might be missed ‘cause of my stupid misery to think about the near future: what would happen tomorrow? Would I make it to the ferryboat back home? Would I miss it? Would I reach land? Would I still be alive and not dying from a sinking old boat or by a meteorite hitting Earth? These seems way too out of line of thoughts, but that’s what my mind does, I told you before, I am a messed up of a man.\nIn any way I should at least try, try to set my mind free from this obstructive ideas, and I’m actually figuring out that writing this piece isn’t helping at all. Let’s try to unfold my emotions then, so that the problem of my sadness could be analyzed and hopefully fixed. I’m sad, sad of leaving a place I’ve been living for nearly three weeks, three weeks are a lot, I just settled here, and suddenly I’ve got to leave? Leave for then re-settle elsewhere? Why? What’s the point of doing that now? Give me a break changing future!\nI’m a creature of habits, I love going to bed after sunset and waking up before sunrise, and I do a sort of ritual every night that my sister would laugh and joke around about it, so change is always difficult for me, I don’t know where my life is going to be leading me tomorrow, and I’m hell scared the out of it! Of course I’m gonna be back at my birthplace, uploading and sorting gigabytes and gigabytes of photos captured during these three weeks from my lovely 27” iMac, and why not, also from my past south-Asian trip I recently took, but what then? I’m sure I’ll figure something out to do, like I always did, but not knowing it NOW, makes me frightened.\nHymn To The Sand\nOh pure beaches,\ndwarf pebbles made out of shells,\nsea creatures,\nrocks.\nyou’ll be missed.\nlike the ocean’s missing land\nwaiting for a comeback\na waving rejoin to ground.\nChange alone doesn’t make me sad, there’s also lots of melancholy going on today. All of the memories I’ve been shared and created with three awesome people, people that made this trip a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable, yes, indeed, you settled in one of the happiest place of my mind as long as I’ll remember, and I’ll always be thankful for that.\nNow the happier part, I don’t want to make you all the way down, let’s conclude by boosting our moods up a bit, the last few paragraphs were very gloomy. Luckily, the other side of my mind thinks that a journey is good, no matter where this will lead me to, or what the cruising vehicle would be, a conveyance is always a great way to change things for the better.\nI LOVE taking airplanes (even though that’s not the case), trains, boats, even driving a cheap bad looking car, as long as that would made me hop on a long journey. The loving part I think is the unpredictability of what a whatever the crossing would be. Getting out there and look at things differently, that always fascinated me.\nOn an airplane you’ve got to see earth from a different perspective; on a ground mean of transport streets and roads and landscapes you never thought would existed; and on a boat cruising water, incredible horizons filled with one of a kind sunrises and sunsets, with why not, a greet from some dolphins on the way. I can’t stop telling you that I love it, I love it so much, so let me go now, my mind is on a-bit-of-a-hurry, but first a last dip into the sea, to make this, a day to be sealed in one of my glorious memories.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviol.one/posts/2017/lastday/","summary":"Sadness, relief, melancholy, happiness; and again, sorrow.

According to Wikipedia:\n“Pescatarianism is the practice of following a diet that includes fish or other seafood, but not the flesh of other animals” I know what you’re thinking … Why did I do that? Well, there’re a few reasons why … Many people around me guessed that I did it because of the recent outcome from the World Health Organization that eating too much meat could be dangerous for our health, but I ain’t done it because of that, I usually eat everything no matter what the impact on my body is as far as makes me feel happy\nThe main reason that pushed me forward in that direction is because I care so much about environment and our beautiful planet, so I’d like to do as much as I could to leave the world better that I found it. To produce just one pound of meat are required over 8 pounds of feed and 8K liters of water, for not talking about the carbon footprint that ground farms have on our planet, making climate change even worse. With the population increasing worldwide, meat is not a solution either for our near future, so why don’t stop eating it now? Plus, tomorrow I’ll be traveling back to the Sibillini’s Mountains national park in Umbria with my lovely family as is almost Easter, and what a better time to undertake that path if not in Easter? Unfortunately there’s a christian tradition here, where lambs and more meat has to be eaten to remember the resurrection of Christ, but how could you eat a lamb, there’re adorable baby animals!\nAnyways, in this little family trip I’m planning to take more beautiful photos from the hikes that we will hopefully do, that I’ll try upload around the web in a few weeks time. I’m not sure about vlogging though, talking to a camera in english around my family makes me very nervous, I’ll try my best ;-)\nHave a great Easter everybody, hope to see you back in the next one!\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviol.one/posts/2016/igaveuponmeat/","summary":"Hi there again in a new blog post, today I’d like to talk about something different, and that is about a recent decision I took, that I’ve been wondering doing it for a very long time.\nAs you could have guessed by the title, I decided to stop eating ground meat, and that classifies me under a therm that I just learned the existence of, yes I am a pescetarian.

You’ll broke the essential part of street photography: capturing the moment, not before, not after; just the right moment!\nBut anyway, let’s get into the main topic of this post, here I was at the Sforza’s castle, and outside there’s this beautiful big fountain where I immediately saw these kids playing around with the water drops, they seemed very happy about it, without caring to be soaked the second just right after.\nI quickly captured four shots with them, which for now I selected the two best ones for you, and I was very lucky.\nSince everything happened pretty quickly, at that moment I didn’t care about exposure, ISO and aperture settings, the only thing that I cared about was to get the shot done: underexposed, overexposed, I didn’t care, I just wanted to have the shot.\nAs you can see, the original is a bit underexposed, that I managed to adjust it later with Adobe’s powerful photo software that is Lightroom.\nI was in the right place, at the right moment, with the right equipment; and that made me think again of how wonderful and true this quote is:\n“The best camera is the one you have with you” What if I hadn’t the X100S with me? I would’ve capture the moment anyway with my crappy iPhone 5 camera (don’t get me wrong, Apple’s cameras are amazing, the reason why mine is bad is because has some dust and scratches inside the sapphire lens), and maybe the result would’ve been equally good if not better than the one captured.\nSometimes, once we have the vision of the perfect shot, we just need to capture it, without thinking and caring so much about the equipment that we have in the hand.\nWell, hope you enjoyed this unusual and weird blog post, if you have something to add, the comment section is right down

rocks or plastic cutlery on a building’s wall.\nThis place was just right on the beach, and because I travelled with my family they of course decided to rest under an umbrella of a soft drinks vendor,

a secondary comfy street on the back of the mountain, and so I took the toughest way climbing rocks and plants on dirt, it wasn’t pleasant as the way back, but I enjoyed it for taking some unique

went).\nAfter that (if you’re following me on snapchat you’re probably already know that), I decided that this wasn’t enough for the day, so I continued hiking the mountain trying to make it to the

allowed to meet in the sky, separated by the milky way during the other days of the year.\nNowadays is believed that writing down wishes on a small piece of paper or bamboo on that day, and then burned or set afloat on a river after the festival, makes those come true.\nSo, because we weren’t allowed to throw wishes on the Tiber river, we decided to burn them on a Sunday in Trevignano, and yesterday was the day.\nWhat I’d wished is to have been in Tokyo or another city of Japan on that day, must have been amazing!\nBut I wasn’t, so, for respect of the Zen Sushi’s customers, we burned

Flickr). I also tried to use for the first time the new app called: ‘Storie’ for share my travel experiences in almost real-time (if you know the app you can follow me @lorenzoviolone and re-watch the videos if you wish).\nHere’s what I did:\nDay 1 This is the day where I flew from FCO (Rome) to BCN (Barcelona) through an airplane. The two hours flight was pretty good: I enjoyed the view, listened to music and played around with some photos on the VSCOcam app.\nWe arrived by evening at 4PM, and we hurried up to the hotel for checking in our room for then jumped to the first part of the city that we wished to visit by sunset. As usual, we spent some time figuring out the tickets at the train station, and so … we missed the sunset.\nEven if we missed it, we had a nice walk in a port zone called “Port Vel” and the famous “Rambla”. Port Vel is amazing, if you ever get a chance to visit Barcelona you cannot miss this place, is very suggestive by night with all the lights of the bridge that took us to the Maremagnum shopping center (an amazing little mall surrounded by the sea).\nFor end the day, we stopped by a market through the Rambla street where we bought some food to eat at our hotel.\nDay 2 We had a bright start of the day back to Port Vel for breakfast at Starbucks with an amazing view of the port (yes, I’m a big fan of Starbucks), we ordered a couple of american coffee with two choco chip cookies, I couldn’t wished more!\nThen we headed to the Barceloneta beach by walk … this place is stellar! Very peaceful and beautiful, with a lot of surfers/skaters/bikers and peoples that just wanted to enjoy their morning in the best way. Again, you cannot miss Barceloneta beach too, is extremely gorgeous! We also took some time here for capturing everything with our cameras.\nAfter that, we jumped to the most important landmark of the entire Spain also known as the greatest unfinished work of Antonio Gaudi, yes, I’m talking about the Sagrada Familia.\nIs useless to say that was the most amazing basilica that I ever seen in my entire life (St. Peter in Vatican city, included), this building is breathtaking … When I first entered I had goosebumps all over my body, I was surprised of how beautiful it was this stunning church.\nThe thing that I liked most of it was the simplicity of the interior colors mixed with the foolish great architecture, you know, when you enter to St. Peter you first noticed that there’s a lot of gold, but there you don’t, looking around you’d see a lot of white and a lot of stunning colors created by the sun rays through the amazing windows.\nThen we went back to the end of Barceloneta beach for lunch (we fell in love with this place), and we saw a group of people playing Quidditch (we guessed) on the sand. We eaten some tapas (little wonderful dishes of food) right next to the beach.\nAfter lunch we headed over Parc Guell for capture the sunset, this time we made it :) Was an amazing park with a stunning skyline view of the city, with also a lot of Gaudi’s works.\nRight after sunset, we wanted to see the famous magic fountain of Barcelona, so, we took the subway and we came to Placa Espanya but unfortunately the fountain was closed, so, we opted for a mall called Las Arenas for dinner.\nHere we eaten a couple of sandwiches with the traditional chocolate and churros, basically an hot chocolate with some bread fried sticks, a delicious!\nThen, we headed back to the hotel for sleep, we had a wonderful day!\nDay 3 Sadly was the last day, and for cheering us up we went to Starbucks again for breakfast (unfortunately where we live Starbucks doesn’t exist yet, so we take advantage of it on every travel we do). I took again another great american coffee, but this time with some pancakes.\nThen we jumped to the Apple Store Passeig de Gràcia (amazing one), and walked in direction to Casa Batllo and Casa mila.\nArrived at destination, we discovered that both of the Casa were a lot expensive, more than the ticket for the Sagrada Familia, so, we just photographed these outside.\nThen, we went to a famous shop in Spain like Harrods in UK or La Rinascente in IT, called: “La Corte Ingles”. We had fun discovering every floor of it :)\nAfter that, we walked again around the Rambla zone in direction to the Maremagnum shopping center, where we had a wonderful paella for lunch and we also did some shopping.\nWe did some last-minute shopping 😄 | @29_franci pic.twitter.com/O8tAW6tZbH\n\u0026mdash; Lorenzo (@lorenzoviolone) January 29, 2015 Then we headed back to the hotel for collecting our suitcases and going to the airport back to Rome.\nIn these three days we had a wonderful time in this beautiful modern city of Spain that I easily recommend to everyone exploring.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviol.one/posts/2015/whatithinkaboutbarcelona/","summary":"In the past week I travelled around the city of Barcelona, Spain, with my lovely sister francesca2910, I did a lot of photos that I still have to upload around (you know ..
