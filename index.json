[{"content":"Today I am very glad to present you my restyled website, rebuilt from the ground up to be faster and better looking than ever.\nI decided to make the switch from an uncomfortable server-lagged cms based hosting (not to say any names, but Tumblr), to static pages hosted from my GitHub repostory and powered by Hugo with a custom version of the PaperMod theme.\nStatic pages means speed! And, oh boy if that is F A S T !\nIt means that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to rely on a server requesting queries from a database to build an html page on the fly every time a user requests for it, that page has already been built for everyone prior the pushed updates, and ready to be downloaded to your screen.\nThe only hassle is for the developer, those static pages thingy is a nerdy process to manage, but worth it for who views the content. The cms (call it how you want it) is in your computer terminal instead of it being online, so you cannot easily switch machine to update your website, you need to do one or more steps before having that, and also is not that possible uploading an article with the iPhone.\nSo, my protocol with updates will be:\n I can start writing articles on a markdown app like Znote or iA Writer on any of my devices, later or, when ready for submission, I can easily write three terminal commands on my main workstation to upload those written pages.  There are two more steps on the way, but I don\u0026rsquo;t mind since I gained: the simplicity of writing posts using markdown instead of HTML, and the huge speed-boost switching from a database powered hosting to just files based hosting.\nI cannot wait to get started on this new journey of mine, and you to be part of. I feel I am more content with my website now than I ever been, and that makes me so inspired by new ideas to put into words with my mighty MacBook keyboard.\nWrite you all soon,\n ❤️,\n Lorenzo.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2021/newhugowebsite/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday I am very glad to present you my restyled website, rebuilt from the ground up to be faster and better looking than ever.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"New Hugo Website"},{"content":"A new year has already begun, leaving us the unspeakable past behind and a whole fresh one to live enjoy and experience.\nMy soulmate and I are still stuck here in the Philippines, living our lives like are on hold, damn ready to touch that play button back but still too far to reach, too hard to push.\nThat unnamable year is not ever worth to call it so, everyone’s lives were clenched by something new that scared the hell out of us all, we were so unprepared that we’re still struggling setting new rules of a new normal that we are incapable to think it at what could now become standard or ever.\nI am stressed more than ever and depression is kicking me back too, leaving me unhappy when I should be the happiest person on planet Earth: living with the love of my life and having an amazing family that supports me in everything I do.\nBut something big is missing, huge parts of me that I forgot to take care of for a way too long time, and my soul is having enough of not doing the things I am supposed to do as a Lorenzo.\nI was Lorenzo, I am Lorenzo and I will be that Lorenzo that you want me to be, but just hold on to it damn it, this is not a good time to be unhappy.

It shoved the path of our modern smartphones, creating a closed and safe environment for all of its users with what we always knew as iOS. It was and it still is a little bit too guarded, a little bit too sealed for signor computer scientists used to a machine like Windows, Mac or Linux, where they have full freedom to control over the operating system with countless possibilities for customization and script/app developments.\nIt was inevitable.\nIf you create an enclosed and safe environment some people are always going to find ways to break in-n-out of it, for no particular reason but to gain the reassurance of being the one who is still being in control having a sort of independence. I get it, we all want to customize our devices as we please but Apple made that hard to their customers for mixed reasons, and no wonder why is still one of the tech companies with the best customer satisfaction. Look at Android for instance, you can install it literally everywhere, but at the finale developers struggle to keep up with all of its devices that often ends in either have to test their apps on every possible gadget, leading to consume lots of team resources, or that their app that might not be fully compatible for all of its users, leaving many unexpected bugs and crashes behind.\nSo, Revolution it is. Fortnite didn’t started it, it was just a sparkle that made the fire stronger. Cydia and Jailbreaks were the pioneers of it, then there was that amazing app called Delta that never made it to the App Store because of its strict guidelines, so people found ways to install it anyways, App Store or not.\nDespite the fact that iOS is still not as customizable as a Mac, and no intention from Apple to merge the two, we have many different options to: buy, install or create our own cool apps that Apple won’t allow releasing on its own store. We have Shortcuts, you can play around for pretty much everything with them, then TestFlight Apple’s own app that makes possible for developers to distribute their apps prior the debut to the App Store for the sole scope to let users beta test their algorithms. And with TestFlight another indie App Store was born, a place where every app is free and not fully overseen by the App Store big eyes (aka strict guidelines), so now developers have even more control on their creations with Airport.\nAs a user you have to submit a request to join their TestFlight beta (that is beta just for incognito reasons at Apple) and you’re all in. I’ve been personally addicted by checking even multiple times a day, what developers can do with it, and we’re off to a great start, a beginning of a cold war of App Stores.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2020/appsrevolution/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt all started back in 2007, when the iPhone went public.

Wake up, cook, eat, zooming, exercise(ish), sleep, repeat. That’s what everyone’s doing, besides the heroes that are keeping us alive in hospitals, grocery stores and research centers.\nWe, all together rediscovered the beauty of baking, spending more quality time with our own families, partaking our creativity beyond our four-boxed home walls to break all together this awful boredom to those invisible fences that this pandemic raised. There’s a beauty behind it, underneath this awful situation darker than our past WW fights some might say: we’re living an unprecedented time, nothing as big as this happened in history and we’re learning, learning to be more decent human beings, not only with ourselves but for our beautiful planet I like to call home as well. We are learning to remove all this clutter we created with innovation in the past decades. Hopefully when all this will be history we will not forget what it means to be united, to fight and live for shared ideals such as repairing this environmental mess we made, or by having simpler meaningful lives like every one of us used to be blessed with. Soon enough all of this will be over, we’ll win the battle like we always did for everything, but we just need to hold tight and do our own little part: everybody, unified.\nFor one reason or another I’ve been living in the Philippines for nearly seven months and counting now with my love and his amazing family. I’ve had so many amazing unrepeatable experiences that I wouldn’t trade for anything in this world, I feel like I’m the luckiest person alive. Now I’m stuck here for who knows how long, every state in the world keeps on extending their own strict quarantines, which I don’t really mind, I do LOVE to be able to live with my better half, waking up next to him every single day is the dreamiest of dreams, but not working enhanced my depression making an awful gloomy comeback. Lorenzo is really not the kind of person capable of staying home doing unproductive chores, so I need to get back to work as soon as the situation allows, also because funds and UK permit are about to expire.\nI dream of living with my partner, and we’ll get there, sadly we need to go back to long distance for a while once again and that will surely break both of our hearts, but who’s favorite story lacks following a bit of drama? I want to be able to walk with my camera laced on my arm, ready to capture whatever my eye tells me to frame, I want to hug my parents and grandparents, I want to go out and eat pizza with them again (yes, ok, I’m Italian), I want to travel, I want to have a family, I’ve so many amazing things to do before I will farewell this reality and I cannot wait to be able to start with something all over again.\nKeep up and stay safe everyone in the meantime,\nLove,\nLorenzo.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2020/abreakfromlife/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHow everyone’s doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, it’s been a while since our last blog-chat and I would be lying if I say I was busy, I’ve been not busy at all in the past few months, let’s just say drowsy and with many thoughts in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"A Break From Life"},{"content":"I recently got back in London from another memorable adventure in East Asia with my Love, and to be honest I haven’t been posting much of it ever since, so I will try to fix this starting today.\nIs so true, when you’re having the time of your life you forget about all of this social media stuff that makes you want to post more and more when you’re all alone in a city miles away from your significant others. Posting to feel good, while empty inside. Trying the best to share the good with the positive, and leave the bad aside, to make your “friends” kind of jealous, to make others engage with your wonderful memories, so to feel a little bit less left behind from this crazy lonely society we all built. Is crazy, but is also true, at least for my lonely depressing life that is in that black hole of a city I attracted myself in.\nSo I was happy .. Wait .. What am I saying? .. I .. I was having the time of my life, exponentially exploding of happiness by all of the positive loving vibes I was surrounded by with each day that passed it, and it was never meant to come to an end, but let’s keep up by saying to a pause. Cause the period I’m in now it’ll pass, it has to. I live to work, I wake up to work, I want to ban weekends to work 5/5 days, even if what I do is a job that doesn’t satisfy me, a job that makes me worthless, a job that I wish nobody would ever do in my position with all of my dreams. I want all of this so time will go quicker, quicker than ever to reach few months in the future from now, when I will finally spend the rest of my life with the man I am truly and deeply in Love with.\nJumping back to the topic of what these three weeks were and why I didn’t post much around, well .. We traveled all across Malaysia, explored another mesmerising spot in the Philippines with all of his loving family and lost ourselves in the magical Singaporean land. It was the time we were both anxiously waiting for six long depressing months, and then me made it, being together again, best travel and life buddies.\nThe first week and a half was a bit of waiting for our trips to happen, but still we did some memorable and new stuff too, exploring for me a bit more of the amazing Filipino culture I now feel fully immersed in. The second weekend was spent in an amazing beach spot in south Negros known as Sipalay: a beach surrounded by mountains .. I know, I didn’t understand it either up until I’ve seen it with my eyes, and everyone should experience that because it was gorgeous. Moving on we took a flight to Singapore, a country new for both of us, where we could really start to be truly explorers for the first time together .. Here we did and explored all sort of things, and photoshoots after another we landed to the Universal Studios where we tried the thrill of not one, but two of the highest interlaced roller coasters in the world, it was crazy but fun. Then Palau Ubin, an island where we could have seen the real Singapore of the 50s and getting lost with our rented bikes on the trail paths of this island. And how to forget this, we even have been feeling rich for a night in the forbidden Marina Bay Sands infinity pool, still crazy to think that we have made it.\nFrom Singapore we tried also for a night the less hotter yet still great city of Malaysia known as Kuala Lumpur, I’ve been back to the amazing Batu Caves where this time I could have really seen the beauty of it by getting lost with our eyes in the colourful steps and temples that they redecorated thorough these couple of years.\nWe had the time of our lives again, and we cannot wait to have countless more starting by the end of this year, just stick with us, is gonna be great! For now here’s a video of our recent second adventure, I hope it will make you feel a glimpse of enjoyment as much as we did.\nUntil next time internet,\nyour Lorenzo.\n ","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2019/nopostsequalsbesttime/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI recently got back in London from another memorable adventure in East Asia with my Love, and to be honest I haven’t been posting much of it ever since, so I will try to fix this starting today.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"No Posts Equals Best Time"},{"content":"I should have probably have written this sooner, but with life and work, here I am doing it now.

It’s been twenty eight memorable days of incredible experiences, not just like been traveling, but being completely immersed into the Filipino culture.\nBut I think I need to flashback you on this story for a second, or a paragraph 😉.\nTwo years ago, like currently, I was really into the Instagram game, and sometimes I casually spammed likes across strategically chosen hashtags in order to gain some likes and followers back. As I was using Filmborn as one of my main editing apps on my iPhone, I’ve been looking through this tag as well to see what creators using the same editing software were sharing; and one of this photos that I hearted changed my life in a way I would never have imagined. By liking this picture I met the best person I will ever know, and eventually, fell in love with him. And to think that it all started by a like of a random tag on a random photo sharing platform, it’s something quite incredible, or as someone would say: destiny. So we started exchanging messages, and video calls for then not being able to think a life without us, so we fell in love. But it was all on the internet, in this gigantic imaginary cloud that connects us to this huge home we’re living called Earth, in such wise it was only logical to take a step forward. Therefor we planned our first meet in person with a travel around Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand; but for some diabolical black forces beyond our control, our plan we had been dying to do miserably failed, but we didn’t give up, in fact our love grew stronger than ever. After two years we’ve been able to remake our plan, and this time we made it! We finally met! Traveling together in one of the best countries I’ve been lucky enough to visit: the Philippines.\nI don’t even know where to start to share the many beautiful memorable moments we had. I’ve been meeting the love of my life, his family, his gorgeous Avalon, I’m so grateful and blessed for all it.

I travelled, and that felt great, you know how much I love to pursuit new adventures around the world with a camera around my neck, ready to capture whatever attire my eyes’ attention. So I’ve been to Asia, where I’ve got to experience a totally different culture, food and people. Then Australia, land of the nature, where you are surrounded by cute and at times dangerous animals, a place to be lived. So Sardinia, breathtaking island in the middle of Mediterranean sea, land of traditions, beaches and flamingoes.\nSuddenly here I am. In my favorite city of my favorite country, who would have thought?\nLondon, to be clear, the one based in England.\nOh men I love this place, I always dreamt to be living a portion of my life up there, and luckily is no longer a dream. Certainly the weather sucks, not gonna lie, but there is something there, something that makes this place special, so special to be called home. So I’m here, seeking for a new (hopefully) exciting carrier in my new independent life bubble, and I cannot wait to tell you all about it.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2017/poppingoutofthebubble/","summary":"","title":"Popping Out Of The Bubble"},{"content":"5 in the morning, alarm rings, everyone wakes up, everyone’s ready for one last adventure before going elsewhere, is our last call to say goodbye. I am an early bird, so I always love waking up possibly before the sun rises, therefor I had my usual: put some clothes on, had a quick round at the bathroom, great breakfast and finally ready to go.\nIt’s now 5.30 and we’re ready to leave, ready for our early expedition seeking the downtime and sunrise at the top of Chia’s tower. So we go, jump in our car and drive off for a ten minutes ride.\nReached the beach it’s already something of marvelous: we caught the down colors just at the right time, just at the perfect instant, were the saturation was at its best. Captured, framed, and imprinted that memory on our SDs, iPhones and neurons.\nA cold breeze is coming through the softly blowing wind, so it reaches our naked feet on the dark frozen morning sand, at this point I have to try it … Suddenly wetting mine in the now warmer salty water of the sea. It’s a good feeling, a felling of freedom, a felling of melting with mother nature, a must call for our anything-could-happen adventure. Now, time to hike the hill. So we did, we’re now in front of the tower, that magnificent tower that Sardinians once used to control and send instant messages thorough the whole island, a remarkable piece of history. But history is nothing against the sun’s light coming up the cloudy horizon.\nSo we waited, and waited, captured more photos, and again, waited. There it is, beyond the final cloud, our lovely nearby warm star is ultimately showing up for the joy of our lenses to see.\nIt’s been wonderful … What a great end to start the day, a day that has yet to be lived.\nMorning Change - a poem\n  Dark spots of light\n rowdy solitude silence\n  everywhere alone\n everywhere empty\n  anywhere to go\n anywhere to be found\n  abruptly,\n a rhapsody of colors is fading\n is now blue yonder\n by the great rays\n of our God’s eye.\n ","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2017/ourlastadventure/","summary":"5 in the morning, alarm rings, everyone wakes up, everyone’s ready for one last adventure before going elsewhere, is our last call to say goodbye.

These are the mixed emotions that I usually feel every time I reach the end of something I do, follow or be.\nToday I’m feeling all of that over again, so I’m happy, but at the same time sad. I’m writing you from my last day of my Chia vacation, here in Sardinia, while looking at the gorgeous beaches surrounded by nothing more than beauty, it’s hard, very hard to say farewell to that. But is in days like these that I have to try my best to enjoy the journey, every little moment of today might be missed ‘cause of my stupid misery to think about the near future: what would happen tomorrow? Would I make it to the ferryboat back home? Would I miss it? Would I reach land? Would I still be alive and not dying from a sinking old boat or by a meteorite hitting Earth? These seems way too out of line of thoughts, but that’s what my mind does, I told you before, I am a messed up of a man.\nIn any way I should at least try, try to set my mind free from this obstructive ideas, and I’m actually figuring out that writing this piece isn’t helping at all. Let’s try to unfold my emotions then, so that the problem of my sadness could be analyzed and hopefully fixed. I’m sad, sad of leaving a place I’ve been living for nearly three weeks, three weeks are a lot, I just settled here, and suddenly I’ve got to leave? Leave for then re-settle elsewhere? Why? What’s the point of doing that now? Give me a break changing future!\nI’m a creature of habits, I love going to bed after sunset and waking up before sunrise, and I do a sort of ritual every night that my sister would laugh and joke around about it, so change is always difficult for me, I don’t know where my life is going to be leading me tomorrow, and I’m hell scared the out of it! Of course I’m gonna be back at my birthplace, uploading and sorting gigabytes and gigabytes of photos captured during these three weeks from my lovely 27” iMac, and why not, also from my past south-Asian trip I recently took, but what then? I’m sure I’ll figure something out to do, like I always did, but not knowing it NOW, makes me frightened.\nHymn To The Sand\n  Oh pure beaches,\n dwarf pebbles made out of shells,\n sea creatures,\n rocks.\n  you’ll be missed.\n  like the ocean’s missing land\n waiting for a comeback\n a waving rejoin to ground.\n Change alone doesn’t make me sad, there’s also lots of melancholy going on today. All of the memories I’ve been shared and created with three awesome people, people that made this trip a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable, yes, indeed, you settled in one of the happiest place of my mind as long as I’ll remember, and I’ll always be thankful for that.\nNow the happier part, I don’t want to make you all the way down, let’s conclude by boosting our moods up a bit, the last few paragraphs were very gloomy. Luckily, the other side of my mind thinks that a journey is good, no matter where this will lead me to, or what the cruising vehicle would be, a conveyance is always a great way to change things for the better.\nI LOVE taking airplanes (even though that’s not the case), trains, boats, even driving a cheap bad looking car, as long as that would made me hop on a long journey. The loving part I think is the unpredictability of what a whatever the crossing would be. Getting out there and look at things differently, that always fascinated me.\nOn an airplane you’ve got to see earth from a different perspective; on a ground mean of transport streets and roads and landscapes you never thought would existed; and on a boat cruising water, incredible horizons filled with one of a kind sunrises and sunsets, with why not, a greet from some dolphins on the way. I can’t stop telling you that I love it, I love it so much, so let me go now, my mind is on a-bit-of-a-hurry, but first a last dip into the sea, to make this, a day to be sealed in one of my glorious memories.\n","permalink":"https://lorenzoviolone.me/posts/2017/lastday/","summary":"Sadness, relief, melancholy, happiness; and again, sorrow.

From there I could spot Chia’s tower, the beach, ripples of waves of what is the mediterranean sea; beyond there is Africa, but if I step back a bit with the eyes (not that I could see Africa by naked-eyes, only by my twisted imagination), I could also see a giant pond, an enclosed large amount of salty water full of flamingoes.\nNot a dream, not a vision, this is the place I dreamt to be, and now I am.\nI’ve been traveling there for almost every year since my birth, but I never got to experience that beauty at this time of year up until now. May, may I call you magical, ‘cause you are … You are an absolute beast for these seascapes. I usually get here in July/August with my family, and this pond is generally very small due to the warmer season that causes evaporation of the water (but I don’t wanna fall into scientific details, even because I don’t know any, okay … maybe for another time nerd Lorenzo), but May, oh May you kept my heart away. May I call you lake at this point (alright, enough playing around with the word May - mayday to myself … Okay, fine … I promise … With that I’m over it), a “lake” with lovely fauna, that the more I look at it, the more I love it.\n“\n Every second,  every minute,\n every hour,  I’m enjoying it more and more.\n ”\n I could stare and frame moments of it the whole day, but the best timing (also under the photographer aspect) is early in the morning or late in the afternoon … Is at this bit of the day that Flamingoes come and go … Walking up and down with their funny tallish legs, in search of food, swimming and walking at the bottom of the pond, having a nice time with great company of their siblings, friends and/or partners. Then the magic happens, suddenly one unfolds his wings and takes off to the sea’s horizon, cruising for a better place to stay at night, and two are instantly following the first, and then three, four … I promptly lost count of them … They’re everywhere in the sky, while we (humans) rest and play on the sands of this wonderful Avalon. The blue yonder is all at once enriched with pure colors of white, pink and black, stamping a smile on us while it’s stealing a small piece of our heart that will be lost forever, forever there, ready to be found again.
