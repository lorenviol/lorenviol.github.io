The two hours flight was pretty good: I enjoyed the view, listened to music and played around with some photos on the VSCOcam app.\nWe arrived by evening at 4PM, and we hurried up to the hotel for checking in our room for then jumped to the first part of the city that we wished to visit by sunset. As usual, we spent some time figuring out the tickets at the train station, and so ‚Ä¶ we missed the sunset.\nEven if we missed it, we had a nice walk in a port zone called ‚ÄúPort Vel‚Äù and the famous ‚ÄúRambla‚Äù. Port Vel is amazing, if you ever get a chance to visit Barcelona you cannot miss this place, is very suggestive by night with all the lights of the bridge that took us to the Maremagnum shopping center (an amazing little mall surrounded by the sea).\nFor end the day, we stopped by a market through the Rambla street where we bought some food to eat at our hotel.\nDay 2 We had a bright start of the day back to Port Vel for breakfast at Starbucks with an amazing view of the port (yes, I‚Äôm a big fan of Starbucks), we ordered a couple of american coffee with two choco chip cookies, I couldn‚Äôt wished more!\nThen we headed to the Barceloneta beach by walk ‚Ä¶ this place is stellar! Very peaceful and beautiful, with a lot of surfers/skaters/bikers and peoples that just wanted to enjoy their morning in the best way. Again, you cannot miss Barceloneta beach too, is extremely gorgeous! We also took some time here for capturing everything with our cameras.\nAfter that, we jumped to the most important landmark of the entire Spain also known as the greatest unfinished work of Antonio Gaudi, yes, I‚Äôm talking about the Sagrada Familia.\nIs useless to say that was the most amazing basilica that I ever seen in my entire life (St. Peter in Vatican city, included), this building is breathtaking ‚Ä¶ When I first entered I had goosebumps all over my body, I was surprised of how beautiful it was this stunning church.\nThe thing that I liked most of it was the simplicity of the interior colors mixed with the foolish great architecture, you know, when you enter to St. Peter you first noticed that there‚Äôs a lot of gold, but there you don‚Äôt, looking around you‚Äôd see a lot of white and a lot of stunning colors created by the sun rays through the amazing windows.\nThen we went back to the end of Barceloneta beach for lunch (we fell in love with this place), and we saw a group of people playing Quidditch (we guessed) on the sand. We eaten some tapas (little wonderful dishes of food) right next to the beach.\nAfter lunch we headed over Parc Guell for capture the sunset, this time we made it :) Was an amazing park with a stunning skyline view of the city, with also a lot of Gaudi‚Äôs works.\nRight after sunset, we wanted to see the famous magic fountain of Barcelona, so, we took the subway and we came to Placa Espanya but unfortunately the fountain was closed, so, we opted for a mall called Las Arenas for dinner.\nHere we eaten a couple of sandwiches with the traditional chocolate and churros, basically an hot chocolate with some bread fried sticks, a delicious!\nThen, we headed back to the hotel for sleep, we had a wonderful day!\nDay 3 Sadly was the last day, and for cheering us up we went to Starbucks again for breakfast (unfortunately where we live Starbucks doesn‚Äôt exist yet, so we take advantage of it on every travel we do). I took again another great american coffee, but this time with some pancakes.\nThen we jumped to the Apple Store Passeig de Gr√†cia (amazing one), and walked in direction to Casa Batllo and Casa mila.\nArrived at destination, we discovered that both of the Casa were a lot expensive, more than the ticket for the Sagrada Familia, so, we just photographed these outside.\nThen, we went to a famous shop in Spain like Harrods in UK or La Rinascente in IT, called: ‚ÄúLa Corte Ingles‚Äù.
